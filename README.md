How dare these puny humans go about their days in absence of fear and terror? Our biological material in our biological labs is beginning to dry up. A restock is in order. Descend upon the humans, and harvest as many of them as possible before returning to our Alien stronghold.

Abduct as many humans as you can while avoiding and finally escaping from the military.


A game made in CSC 371 - Game Design at California Polytechnic State University.
